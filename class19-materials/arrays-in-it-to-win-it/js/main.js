//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let moviesTitles = ['coach carter', 'Space Jam', 'Nice Kick']
//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
var movieOne = moviesTitles[0]
//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let arrayLength = moviesTitles.length
//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
let lastArray = moviesTitles[ arrayLength -1]
